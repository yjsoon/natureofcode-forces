# p5.js Physics Sketch

A simple physics simulation created with p5.js.

This sketch demonstrates basic physics concepts like gravity, friction, drag, and external forces (fans) acting on a ball within a 2D environment containing platforms and a water zone. It also includes a timer that stops when the ball reaches a designated goal area.

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have a local web server set up.
2.  Serve the directory containing `index.html`, `sketch.js`, and the necessary p5.js library files.
3.  Open the served `index.html` in your web browser.
